## The teamwork Section: 
1. Using Github, you understand how to use the fork option, pull request option. 
2. Commit, push, and pull activity must be considered in the reasonable gap. Any big gap of the commit without further explanation in the report will assume as an individual submission. For instance, you have three members and only one member active to develop your program. The other two will grade as 0.
